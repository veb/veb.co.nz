## Oh, macOS Catalinaâ€¦ 

When I ran `react-native run-ios` it would simply tell me there were no simulators. LIES! 

If you run into this error, simply remove your `node_modules` and install again. (I use `yarn`)

Make sure you actually have an iPhone X via XCode. It has a device manager. You can download all sorts of simulators.
